An open-source version of the EFF's Panopticlick. Is currently in beta. Basically functional but has room for improvement.

# Installation
Here we give a quick overview of one way the project can be deployed.
You need to have Apache Tomcat and MySQL installed for this to work.

  * Start MySQL.
  * Run the create.sql file found in the src directory through MySQL.
  * Copy the file browserprint.war to your Tomcat webapps directory.
  * Start Tomcat (`<`TomcatDirectory`>`/bin/startup.sh). The .war file will be automatically unpacked by Tomcat.
  * Stop Tomcat (`<`TomcatDirectory`>`/bin/shutdown.sh).
  * Delete the file browserprint.war from your webapps directory.
  * Edit browserprint/META-INFO/context.xml to fit your database.
  * Configure the server's public IP address as serversPublicIP in browserprint/WEB-INF/web.xml.
  * Check web.xml.README for other configurable options you may want to use in browserprint/WEB-INF/web.xml.
  * Start Tomcat.

The page can now be accessed at http://localhost:8080/browserprint/ (assuming default Tomcat settings).

This project was created using the Eclipse IDE configured to use Tomcat and can be easily set up and modified using them.
