An open-source browser fingerprinting suite, inspired by the EFF's Panopticlick.

# Installation
Here we give a quick overview of one way the project can be deployed.
You need to have Apache Tomcat and MariaDB installed for this to work.

  * Start MariaDB.
  * (optional but recommended) [Configure your database to support UTF-8](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3513812)
  * Run the `create.sql` file found in the `src` directory of the repository through MariaDB.
  * Delete (or move) everything from the Tomcat `webapps` directory.
  * Download the file `browserprint.war` from the repository or build it yourself for a (possibly) more update version (we build it using the Eclipse IDE and a project consisting of the `src` and `WebContent` directories of the repository).
  * Copy the file `browserprint.war` to your `<TomcatDirectory>/webapps` directory.
  * Add the line `<Context path="" docBase="browserprint" debug="0" reloadable="true"></Context>` inside the Host tags to `<TomcatDirectory>/conf/server.xml`.
  * Start Tomcat (`<TomcatDirectory>/bin/startup.sh`). The `.war` file will be automatically unpacked by Tomcat.
  * Stop Tomcat (`<TomcatDirectory>/bin/shutdown.sh`).
  * Delete the file `browserprint.war` from your `webapps` directory.
  * Edit `<TomcatDirectory>/webapps/browserprint/META-INFO/context.xml` to fit your database.
  * Configure the server's public IP address as serversPublicIP in `browserprint/WEB-INF/web.xml`.
  * Check `web.xml.README` for other configurable options you may (and probably should) want to use in `browserprint/WEB-INF/web.xml`.
  * Start Tomcat.

The page can now be accessed at http://localhost:8080/ (assuming default Tomcat settings).

This project was created using the Eclipse IDE configured to use Tomcat and can be easily set up and modified using them.

# Optional
* Remove or replace the Creative Commons license on the output of the web application in `WebContent/WEB-INF/footer.jsp`.
  You are only required to retain the MIT license on the code, not the CC license on the web application output.
