#summary A quick overview of how to get the project up and running.

= Installation =
Here we give a quick overview of one way the project can be deployed.
You need to have Apache Tomcat and MySQL installed for this to work.

 * Run the create.sql file found in the src directory through MySQL.
 * Copy the file libre-panopticlick.war to your Tomcat webapps directory.
 * Start Tomcat. The .war file will be automatically unpacked by Tomcat.
 * Stop Tomcat.
 * Delete the file libre-panopticlick.war from your webapps directory.
 * Edit libre-panopticlick/META-INFO/context.xml to fit your database.
 * Start Tomcat.

The page can now be accessed at http://localhost:8080/libre-panopticlick/ (assuming default Tomcat settings).

This project was created using the Eclipse IDE configured to use Tomcat and can be easily set up and modified using them.
