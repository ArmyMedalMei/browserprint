### IQ test (or similar CAPTCHA)
Present simple puzzles to the user and have them solve them to pass the CAPTCHA.
Tests would need to scale in difficulty based on how many a user gets right / wrong.
Probably more unstable than other tests and require more than one instance of the CAPTCHA to get a decent reading.
Not really worth implementing because it requires multiple tests to be useful and it would be difficult to implement, plus ethical issues with fingerprinting users instead of browsers, plus we've already got a CAPTCHA.

### Hearing test CAPTCHA
Present an audio CAPTCHA where parts of it are, for instance, high frequency so not everybody can hear them.
Not really worth implementing because it would take a huge amount of effort and research, plus ethical issues with fingerprinting users instead of browsers, plus we've already got a CAPTCHA.

### Select Language Test
Not really a test, you just allow the user to select the language of the website and then based off of that you can potentially learn about additional languages the person knows.
Limited usefulness because it requires translations of all pages it's used on.
