### Internet speed
Download something and time how long it takes.

### Adblocking, acceptable ads
To augment the ad blocking test we can see if ``acceptable ads'' are allowed by the browser.
Adblock and Adblock Plus:

Problem is acceptable ads are probably tied to domain; need to experiment to see if we can trick it.
Or alternatively we could just put an ``acceptable ad'' on the page and see if it's shown.

### Suspicious file blocking
Browserprint at one point wouldn't work for browsers that had Adblock installed and configured in a certain way.
The reason for this is that the main JS file was called fingerprint.js and one of Adblock's lists blocked this.
We can test with a range of file names to see if they're blocked or not.
Thinks that may be blocked:
-Anti-adblock messages.

-Social media buttons.
	https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/fanboy-social.txt
-Things that might affect privacy (like fingerprint.js).

-Other annoyances (RSS stuff, EU cookies stuff, more of what appears to be social media buttons).

-Malware domains.

### IQ test (or similar CAPTCHA)
Present simple puzzles to the user and have them solve them to pass the CAPTCHA.
Tests would need to scale in difficulty based on how many a user gets right / wrong.
Probably more unstable than other tests and require more than one instance of the CAPTCHA to get a decent reading.
Not really worth implementing because it requires multiple tests to be useful and it would be difficult to implement, plus ethical issues with fingerprinting users instead of browsers, plus we've already got a CAPTCHA.

### Hearing test CAPTCHA
Present an audio CAPTCHA where parts of it are, for instance, high frequency so not everybody can hear them.
Not really worth implementing because it would take a huge amount of effort and research, plus ethical issues with fingerprinting users instead of browsers, plus we've already got a CAPTCHA.

May be a replacement for window size.
Varies based on whether window is windowed or not.

### Select Language Test
Not really a test, you just allow the user to select the language of the website and then based off of that you can potentially learn about additional languages the person knows.
Limited usefulness because it requires translations of all pages it's used on.
