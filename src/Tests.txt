# Supported Tests
Libre-Panopticlick implements the following tests:

### User Agent
The User-Agent header sent with the HTTP request for the page.

### HTTP\_ACCEPT Headers
The concatenation of three headers from the HTTP request:
the Accept request header, the Accept-Encoding request header, and the Accept-Language request header.

### Browser Plugin Details
A list of the browsers installed plugins as detected using JavaScript.

### Time Zone
The time-zone configured on the client's machine.

### Screen Size and Color Depth
The screen size and colour depth of the monitor displaying the client's web browser.

### System Fonts
The fonts installed on the client's machine, detected using Flash.

### Are Cookies Enabled?
Whether cookies are enabled.

### Limited supercookie test
Three tests of whether DOM storage is supported (and enabled) in the client's web browser.
Tests for localStorage, sessionStorage, and Internet Explorer's userData.

### Do Not Track header
The value of the DNT (Do Not Track) header from the HTTP request.

### Client/server time difference (minutes)
The approximate amount of difference between the time on the client's computer and the clock on the server.
i.e., the clock on the client's computer is 5 minutes ahead of the clock on the server.

### Date/Time format test
When the JavaScript function toLocaleString() is called on a date it can reveal information about the language of the browser via the names of days and months.
For instance the output 'Thursday January 01, 10:30:00 GMT+1030 1970' reveals that English is our configured language because 'Thursday' is English.
Additionally different browsers tend to return differently formatted results.
For instance Opera returns the above whereas Firefox returns '1/1/1970 9:30:00 am' for the same date (UNIX epoch).
Additionally timezone information may be revealed.
For instance the above were taken on a computer configured for CST (+9:30), which is why the times shown aren't midnight.

### Math / Tan function
The same math functions run on different platforms and browsers can produce different results.
In particular we are interested in the output of Math.tan(-1e300), which has been observed to produce different values depending on operating system.
For instance on a 64bit Linux machine it produces the value -1.4214488238747245 and on a Windows machine it produces the value -4.987183803371025.

### Using Tor?
Checks whether a client's request came from a Tor exit node, and hence whether they're using Tor.
It does so by performing a TorDNSEL request for each client.
